-- | Create local files and directories based on the entries of a tar archive.
--
-- This is a portable implementation of unpacking suitable for portable
-- archives. It handles 'NormalFile' and 'Directory' entries and has simulated
-- support for 'SymbolicLink' and 'HardLink' entries. Links are implemented by
-- copying the target file. This therefore works on Windows as well as Unix.
-- All other entry types are ignored, that is they are not unpacked and no
-- exception is raised.
--
-- If the 'Entries' ends in an error then it is raised an an exception. Any
-- files or directories that have been unpacked before the error was
-- encountered will not be deleted. For this reason you may want to unpack
-- into an empty directory so that you can easily clean up if unpacking fails
-- part-way.
--
-- On its own, this function only checks for security (using 'checkSecurity').
-- You can do other checks by applying checking functions to the 'Entries' that
-- you pass to this function. For example:
--
-- > unpack dir (checkTarbomb expectedDir entries)
--
-- If you care about the priority of the reported errors then you may want to
-- use 'checkSecurity' before 'checkTarbomb' or other checks.
